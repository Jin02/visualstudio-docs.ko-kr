|**Publish to the cloud:** You can make applications, services, and data available from anywhere by using Visual Studio to deploy them to Microsoft Azure.|[Publishing Applications to Microsoft Azure](/visualstudio/deployment/quickstart-deploy-to-azure)|  
|**Publish a Windows Store app:** You can easily build, submit, and sell your apps from the Windows Store to customers around the world.|[Packaging, deployment, and query of Windows Store apps](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh446593\(v=vs.85\).aspx)|  
|**Publish a Windows Phone app:** You can submit a new app or an update to an existing app for certification on the Windows Phone Dev Center.|[Publish a Windows Phone App](https://developer.microsoft.com/)|  
|**Deploy an ASP.NET application or service:** You can deploy ASP.NET applications and services in a number of different ways.|[Deploying ASP.NET web applications and services](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/mvc/overview/deployment/)|  
|**Deploy a LightSwitch application or service:** After you create applications and OData services by using LightSwitch, you can deploy them to a web server or to Microsoft Azure.|[LightSwitch 애플리케이션 배포](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/4818d933-295c-4ecc-9148-7ad9ca28dcdb)|  
|**Publish an app for SharePoint:** You can publish an app for SharePoint to the Office Store or to an app catalog for an internal organization.|[Publish an app for SharePoint by using Visual Studio](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/jj220044\(v=office.15\).aspx)|

|**Deploy a WCF service:** Other applications can use WCF RIA services that you deploy to a web server.|[Deploying WCF RIA Services Solutions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff426912\(v=vs.91\).aspx)|  
|**Deploy an OData service:** Other applications can use OData services that you deploy to a web server.|[Deploy an OData Service](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh973447.aspx)|  
|**Deploy a desktop application:** By using ClickOnce deployment, you can publish a desktop application to a web server or a network file share. 이렇게 하면 사용자가 클릭 한 번으로 애플리케이션을 설치할 수 있습니다.|[ClickOnce 보안 및 배포](../deployment/clickonce-security-and-deployment.md)|  
|**Create a setup program:** You can create a setup program by using InstallShield Limited Edition, which is free.|[InstallShield Limited Edition](../deployment/installshield-limited-edition.md)|  
|**Maintain an existing setup program:** Continue using a setup program created in an earlier version of Visual Studio by installing the Visual Studio Installer Projects Extension.|[Visual Studio Installer Projects Extension](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-installer-projects-extension/)<br /><br /> Documentation for installer projects is available here: [Visual Studio Installer Deployment](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/2kt85ked\(v=vs.100\).aspx)|  
|**Deploy a Visual C++ application:** You can deploy the Visual C++ runtime with an application by using central deployment, local deployment, or static linking.|[네이티브 데스크톱 애플리케이션 배포(Visual C++)](/cpp/windows/deploying-native-desktop-applications-visual-cpp)|  
|**Deploy an application for testing:** You can enable more sophisticated development and testing by deploying your applications into virtual environments.|[랩 환경에서 테스트](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/14ba54c8-a158-4a6e-b00a-b00ae960feb8)|  
|**Install prerequisites:** You can install prerequisite components for desktop applications by configuring a generic installer, which is known as a bootstrapper.|[애플리케이션 배포 필수 조건](../deployment/application-deployment-prerequisites.md)|
